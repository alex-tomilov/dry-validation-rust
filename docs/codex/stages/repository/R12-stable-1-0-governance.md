# Codex stage R12: stable `1.0` governance

> Feed Codex this entire file after `00-CODEX-GLOBAL-INSTRUCTIONS.md`.

## Repository context

Work in the current `dry-validation-rust` repository. Inspect the branch, implementation, tests, documentation, and recent related changes before editing. Do not assume every path or API named below is still exact.

## Assignment

Implement only this public-repository maturity stage. Keep it suitable for one focused pull request. When the stage is explicitly large, split it into the smallest dependency-ordered PRs and complete only the first coherent PR unless the user explicitly asks for the whole sequence.

**Priority:** Future stable gate

Before `1.0`, publish:

- semantic versioning policy;
- deprecation policy;
- native plan versioning/migration policy;
- supported Ruby/platform lifecycle;
- compatibility reference policy;
- security patch policy;
- release cadence philosophy;
- maintainer governance.

## `1.0` must not mean

- complete upstream feature parity;
- GVL-free execution;
- every platform;
- zero intentional differences.

It should mean:

- the documented subset is stable;
- compatibility is executable and versioned;
- installation works on advertised platforms;
- failures are explicit;
- upgrade behavior is governed;
- production use has real evidence.

## Mandatory execution sequence

1. Inspect relevant code, tests, build files, and documentation.
2. Restate current behavior and the minimal proposed design.
3. Identify assumptions in this prompt that do not match the current repository.
4. Add/update regression and boundary tests.
5. Implement the focused change.
6. Run focused checks.
7. Run canonical full verification.
8. Review the diff for unrelated behavior or compatibility changes.
9. Update documentation/changelog only where justified.
10. Stop without publishing or changing remote repository settings.

## Scope control

- Do not perform adjacent roadmap stages.
- Do not add unrelated DSL features.
- Do not hide an upstream mismatch by weakening canonicalization or tests.
- Do not claim optimization without measurements.
- If the full stage cannot safely fit one PR, provide a PR breakdown and implement the first self-contained part.

## Final response format

Return:

1. **Summary**
2. **Current behavior confirmed**
3. **Files changed**
4. **Implementation details**
5. **Design decisions / rejected alternatives**
6. **Public API and compatibility impact**
7. **Tests and exact commands**
8. **Benchmark evidence**, if applicable
9. **Known limitations / follow-ups**
10. **Risks / rollback**
11. **No-release confirmation**
